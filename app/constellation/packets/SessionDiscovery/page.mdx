`ConstaNetSessionDiscovery` is the packet type used by Constellation Network nodes to request that other nodes announce their active sessions.  
When a node sends this message, peers are expected to respond with [`ConstaNetSessionAnnounce`](./ConstaNetSessionAnnounce.gd) packets describing the sessions they host or participate in.

This packet carries **no additional payload** beyond the standard ConstaNet header.

## Packet Structure
